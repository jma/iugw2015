## The New RERO Statistics Services: Abstract

More and more RERO professionals are asking for statistics on the use of the
RERO DOC server. They want to know, for a certain period, what are the most
consulted records, which files are more uploaded, which collections are more
popular, etc. They also want to customize results by selecting multiple
filters: i.e. what are the document types most seen for the University of
Fribourg from January to March 2014 in Economics.

Using recent tools such as Elasticsearch, AngularJS, Highcharts javascript
library, etc., we decided to develop a new specific interface using the server
logs and Invenio. One of the most challenging aspect was how to filter internet
bot (crawlers, robots), especially those appearing as human.
